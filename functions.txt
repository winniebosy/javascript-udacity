function to reverse a string example

function reverseString(name) {
    var reversed ="";
    for(var i = name.length-1; i>=0; i--){
        reversed += name[i];
    }
    return reversed;
}
reverseString('Bosibori');

'irobisoB'




function findAverage(x, y) {
  var answer = (x + y) / 2;
  return answer;
}

var avg = findAverage(5, 9);



x and y are parameters! They are defined in the function declaration. The values 5, and 9 are passed in as function arguments.




How to declare a function
Functions allow you to package up lines of code that you can use (and often reuse) in your programs.

Sometimes they take parameters like the pizza button from the beginning of this lesson. reheatPizza() had one parameter: the number of slices.

function reheatPizza(numSlices) {
  // code that figures out reheat settings!
}
The reverseString() function that you saw also had one parameter: the string to be reversed.

function reverseString(reverseMe) {
  // code to reverse a string!
}
In both cases, the parameter is listed as a variable after the function name, inside the parentheses. And, if there were multiple parameters, you would just separate them with commas.

function doubleGreeting(name, otherName) {
  // code to greet two people!
}
But, you can also have functions that don't have any parameters. Instead, they just package up some code and perform some task. In this case, you would just leave the parentheses empty. Take this one for example. Here's a simple function that just prints out "Hello!".

// accepts no parameters! parentheses are empty
function sayHello() {
  var message = "Hello!"
  console.log(message);
}
If you tried pasting any of the functions above into the JavaScript console, you probably didn't notice much happen. In fact, you probably saw undefined returned back to you. undefined is the default return value on the console when nothing is explicitly returned using the special return keyword.

Return statements
In the sayHello() function above, a value is printed to the console with console.log, but not explicitly returned with a return statement. You can write a return statement by using the return keyword followed by the expression or value that you want to return.

// declares the sayHello function
function sayHello() {
  var message = "Hello!"
  return message; // returns value instead of printing it
}
How to run a function
Now, to get your function to do something, you have to invoke or call the function using the function name, followed by parentheses with any arguments that are passed into it. Functions are like machines. You can build the machine, but it won't do anything unless you also turn it on. Here's how you would call the sayHello() function from before, and then use the return value to print to the console:

// declares the sayHello function
function sayHello() {
  var message = "Hello!"
  return message; // returns value instead of printing it
}

// function returns "Hello!" and console.log prints the return value
console.log(sayHello());
Prints: "Hello!"

Parameters vs. Arguments
At first, it can be a bit tricky to know when something is either a parameter or an argument. The key difference is in where they show up in the code. A parameter is always going to be a variable name and appears in the function declaration. On the other hand, an argument is always going to be a value (i.e. any of the JavaScript data types - a number, a string, a boolean, etc.) and will always appear in the code when the function is called or invoked.





What you've learned so far:
Functions package up code so you can easily use (and reuse) a block of code. Parameters are variables that are used to store the data that's passed into a function for the function to use. Arguments are the actual data that's passed into a function when it is invoked:

// x and y are parameters in this function declaration
function add(x, y) {
  // function body
  // Here, `sum` variable has a scope within the function. 
  // Such variables defined within a function are called Local variables
  // You can try giving it another name
  var sum = x + y;
  return sum; // return statement
}

// 1 and 2 are passed into the function as arguments, 
// and the result returned by the function is stored in a new variable `sum`
// Here, `sum` is another variable, different from the one used inside the function
var sum = add(1, 2);
The function body is enclosed inside curly brackets:

function add(x, y) {
  // function body!
}
Return statements explicitly make your function return a value:

return sum;
You invoke or call a function to have it do something:

add(1, 2);
Returns: 3




ite a function called laugh() that takes one parameter, num that represents the number of "ha"s to return.
solution
var sound = "" ; 
function laugh(num) {
    for (var x = 0 ; x < num ; x++) {
        sound = sound + "ha" ;  
    }
    sound = sound +"!"; 
    return sound; 
}

console.log(laugh(3)) ;



Returning A value
-Returning statements are used to exit functions
Itâ€™s important to understand that return and print are not the same thing. Printing a value to the JavaScript console only displays a value (that you can view for debugging purposes), but the value it displays can't really be used for anything more than that. For this reason, you should remember to only use console.log to test your code in the JavaScript console.

Paste the following function declaration and function invocation into the JavaScript console to see the difference between logging (printing) and returning:

function isThisWorking(input) {
  console.log("Printing: isThisWorking was called and " + input + " was passed in as an argument.");
  return "Returning: I am returning this string!";
}

isThisWorking(3);
Prints: "Printing: isThisWorking was called and 3 was passed in as an argument"
Returns: "Returning: I am returning this string!"

If you don't explicitly define a return value, the function will return undefined by default.

Example of using mutliple return statements
function sleep() {
  console.log("I'm sleepy!");
  return "zzz";
  return "snore";
}

sleep();

Explanation:
The function will return "zzz" and print "I'm sleepy!" to the console. "snore" will not be returned since the first return statement will exit the function.



However, it is possible to have multiple return statements in a function.

For instance, you could use a conditional to specify when each of the return statements is evaluated. You could, for example, only return the value of 1 if the string "one" was passed into the test() function. Else, you could return the value of 2.
